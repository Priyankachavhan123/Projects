Project Name: Data Visualization and Analysis with Power BI, Tableau, SQL, and Excel

In this project, I have explored the world of data visualization and analysis by harnessing the power of leading tools like Power BI, Tableau, SQL, and Excel. By leveraging CSV files as data sources, I've created visually stunning and insightful dashboards and reports that enable better decision-making and uncover hidden trends and patterns.

With my expertise in SQL, I've executed complex queries to transform raw data into meaningful insights, enhancing the overall data visualization experience. This project demonstrates how to effectively combine the capabilities of these powerful tools to gain actionable insights from datasets and present them in a user-friendly manner.
